//this part is acutally what changes the elements


//access the document and search for each of the three ids and use the onlick attribute to call the function- dont need the () on the function call.


//functions after the elements
function turnRed() {
    //call the clear function

//change the color of the element to Red
}
function turnYellow() {
//call the clear function

//change the color of the element to Yellow
}
function turnGreen() {
//call the clear function

//change the color of the element to Green
}
function clear(){
    // you can use the single or double in js- also the semi colon doesnt matter but i like to put it there just because it offers better readability

 //access the elements by the ID (each of them 3 lines) and change the background color to the same as the style (#333)
